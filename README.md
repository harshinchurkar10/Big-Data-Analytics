#  Big Data Analytics Practicals

This repository contains a curated set of practical experiments for the Big Data Analytics course. Each practical focuses on applying core concepts of data analysis, statistical testing, and machine learning using Python and Weka. The goal is to build hands-on experience with real-world data processing and interpretation techniques.

## Practicals Included

- Count and analyze unique and duplicate values in datasets
- Perform and interpret Normal Distribution
- Implement Naive Bayes and evaluate using Confusion Matrix & K-Fold Cross Validation
- Conduct Z-Test, T-Test, and ANOVA (Parametric Tests)
- Apply and evaluate Logistic Regression and Linear Regression algorithms
- Analyze data using Correlation Matrix and Confusion Matrix
- Study and install the Weka AI tool for machine learning applications

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **AI Tool:** Weka (GUI-based machine learning toolkit)

##  Objective

To develop practical skills in Big Data Analytics by applying statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization techniques to real-world datasets.
